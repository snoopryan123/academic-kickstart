It was my job to find the value of exotic contracts such as the [carried interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/carriedinterest.asp) of a hedge fund and the [earnout](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnout.asp) of an acquisition of one company by another. My boss wanted me to use a [Black-Scholes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackscholes.asp) framework to value these contracts, since they have [option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp) -like features. My coworkers, however, did not have the time or knowledge to teach me about options pricing and the Black-Scholes formula (and none of them were mathematicians). So, I took it upon myself to learn about the fundamentals of options pricing, and summarized what I learned here.","tags":null,"title":"Options Pricing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryan Brill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1524441600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524441600,"objectID":"d3dcd83b41fbcb79acbab4165540750d","permalink":"/ryansbrill.com/publication/betting/","publishdate":"2018-04-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ryansbrill.com/publication/betting/","section":"publication","summary":"I discuss a fundamental probabilistic strategy in sports betting and poker.","tags":null,"title":"Betting and Basic Probability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryan Brill"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1520985600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520985600,"objectID":"0effeac0bc52efd2bc9ec30013cf6f78","permalink":"/ryansbrill.com/publication/moneylines/","publishdate":"2018-03-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/ryansbrill.com/publication/moneylines/","section":"publication","summary":"I discuss moneylines and implied win probability for sports games.","tags":null,"title":"Moneylines and Win Probability","type":"publication"}]
