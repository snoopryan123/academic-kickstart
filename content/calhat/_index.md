# What is calhat?

You're wrong. [**calhat**](https://www.instagram.com/officialcalhat) is not a *what*. It is not merely a tangible object. Rather, [**calhat**](https://www.instagram.com/officialcalhat) is a lifestyle; it is a community of people unified under one principle: [**calhat**](https://www.instagram.com/officialcalhat).

As you can tell by our suave cursive font, [**calhat**](https://www.instagram.com/officialcalhat) connects letters. Specifically, we unite two grand ideas: [Cal](https://www.berkeley.edu), the university we know and love, and [hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat), our favorite accessory. Moreover, [**calhat**](https://www.instagram.com/officialcalhat) connects people. When you wear a [**calhat**](https://www.instagram.com/officialcalhat with your friend, walking down the street in Berkeley, you can be sure that you two are on the same page. Beyond this, you two become a fortress, an intrepid bastion, ready to tackle any obstacle. Thus, it is the [connection](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/connection) between the "l" and the "h", right in the middle of our [**calhat**](https://www.instagram.com/officialcalhat) logo, that provides the crux of what we are about: [**calhat connects letters and people**](https://www.instagram.com/officialcalhat).
