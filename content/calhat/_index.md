# I've been to some delicious restaurants around the world. Here are some favorites!

## **Barbeque**

#### [Pappy's Smokehouse, St. Louis](https://www.pappyssmokehouse.com)

1.5 hour line to get in. Tender baby back ribs, savory barbque sauce, unbeatable fries.

## **Italian**

#### [Hostaria Romana, Rome](http://www.hostariaromana.it)

Simply the best Spaghetti alla Carbonara (a sauce featuring eggs and thick juicy bacon).

#### [Rao's, Los Angeles](http://www.raosrestaurants.com/our_story.html)

The biggest bowl of Bolognese I've ever seen at a restaurant. The red sauce here is so tasty that I continually buy it on Amazon to cook with. Even better than the food is the greeter, Johnny Williams, a.k.a. Johnny Roastbeef from the 1990 classic Goodfellas, whose stereotypical Brooklyn-Italian-mobster persona lights up the room.

## **Thai**

#### [Sra Bua by Kiin Kiin, Bangkok](http://www.srabuabykiinkiin.com/en)

2019 Michelin Star Restaurant. Upscale modern interpretation on Thai cuisine. Lobster with basil sorbet. Mango sticky rice with melted cotton candy. A delicious leaf whose name a forgot.

## **Fries**

#### [Reddi-Chick BBQ, Los Angeles](https://reddichickbbq.com)

These fries are so good that I went here to get fries to-go before eating lunch at a different restaurant accross the street.

## **Chocolate Sorbet**

#### [Babbo, New York City](https://www.babbonyc.com)

Upscale Italian fare in Greenwich Village. The chocolate sorbet here was so rich that it felt more like chocolate soup.

## **British with French Influence**

#### [Castle Terrace, Edinburgh](https://castleterracerestaurant.com)

2011 Michelin Star Restaurant. All about representing Scotland's finest produce, I recall eating a plethora of inventive dishes whose particulars I forgot, but whose delicious taste and notable impression will stay with me forever.

## **Indian**

#### [Amber India, San Fransisco](https://www.amber-india.com/location/san-francisco/)

I came here for the lunch buffet and ate so much food that afterwards I had to take a 15 minute nap on the floor outside the restaurant. The buffet featured a menagerie of meats, veges, pancakes/breads, and sauces.

## **Burger**

#### [The Little Bear, Los Angeles](https://littlebearla.com)

The juiciest, most tender burger I've ever had. Patty to die for. Delicious thrice-fried belgian fries. Very cool DTLA vibe.

## **Steak**

#### [Chicago Cut Steakhouse, Chicago](http://www.chicagocutsteakhouse.com)

Overlooking the Chicago river, I ate a juicy, tender rib eye with an appropriate (i.e. copious) amount of fries.

## **Favorite Vegetable**

#### [Purple yam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioscorea_alata)
