# What is `calhat`?

You're wrong. `calhat` is not a *what*. It is not merely a tangible object. Rather, `calhat` is a lifestyle; it is a community of people unified under one principle: `calhat`.

As you can tell by our suave cursive font, `calhat` connects letters. Specifically, we unite two grand ideas: [Cal](https://www.berkeley.edu), the university we know and love, and [hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat), our favorite accessory. When you wear a `calhat`, everyone will unambiguously know that you love [Cal](https://www.berkeley.edu), and that you are wearing a [hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat). Moreover, `calhat` connects people. When you wear a `calhat` with your friend, walking down the street in Berkeley, you can be sure that you two are on the same page. Beyond this, you two become a fortress, an intrepid bastion, ready to tackle any obstacle. Thus, it is the connection between the "l" and the "h", right in the middle of our `calhat` logo, that provides the crux of what we are about: [**calhat connects letters and people**](https://www.instagram.com/officialcalhat).
