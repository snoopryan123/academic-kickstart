Currently, I am a student at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu) double majoring in [Mathematics](https://math.berkeley.edu) and [Statistics](https://statistics.berkeley.edu) and minoring in [Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu). I am a [Regents and Chancellors' Scholar](https://financialaid.berkeley.edu/regents-and-chancellors-scholarship). Once I graduate, I plan to further my studies and attain a Ph.D.

Outside of class, I have used my math/statistics/CS knowledge by engaging in [research](#writings), joining the Berkeley math [directed reading program](#writings), interning at a [business valuation firm](https://www.stout.com/services/complex-securities-and-financial-instruments), and thinking about [sports betting](#writings).

Also, I lead a [business](/calhat/), [draw](/art/), make [rap instrumentals](/music/), and [eat](/food/).

Please enjoy this picture of me at a [Husky Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/neverlandsiberians/) in Bangkok, Thailand.
