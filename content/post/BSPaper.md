title: "Options Pricing"
subtitle: ""
summary: "Last summer, I interned in the Complex Securities Valuation group of Stout, a global valuation advisory firm. It was my job to find the value of exotic contracts such as the carried interest of a hedge fund and the earnout of an acquisition of one company by another. My boss wanted me to use a Black-Scholes framework to value these contracts, since they have option-like features. My coworkers, however, did not have the time or knowledge to teach me about options pricing and the Black-Scholes formula (and none of them were mathematicians). So, I took it upon myself to learn about the fundamentals of options pricing, and summarized what I learned here."
