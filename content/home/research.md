* Thesis

## Mathematics Honors Thesis

#### UC Berkeley, August 2019 - May 2020

Continuing my research done at the summer 2019 [RIPS Singapore](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/student-research-programs/research-in-industrial-projects-for-students-rips-2019-singapore/) program, detailed below, in my thesis I will explore Type Theory in greater depth and attempt to implement an extensive type-theoretic theorem prover in Python.

## RIPS Singapore REU

#### National University of Singapore, June 2019 - August 2019

* Led a group of undergraduates in RIPS ([Research in Industrial Projects for Students](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/student-research-programs/research-in-industrial-projects-for-students-rips-2019-singapore/)) at NUS ([National University of Singapore](https://ims.nus.edu.sg))
* Sponsored by [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/), my project was entitled “Exploring a Type-Theoretic Environment for Python”
* [Type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory) is an alternative to [Set Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory), and it is easier for a computer to check type-theoretic proofs
* Current type-theoretic theorem provers like [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr) are robust, but have a steep learning curve and are difficult to use, so Nvidia wanted us to explore creating a type-theoretic theorem proving environment in Python, with emphasis on ease-of-use and ability to link to Nvidia’s ML and AI algorithms
* Learned about type theory, building a theorem prover, Coq, how to work on math in a team, how to write an extensive math report, and how to give a mathematics talk
* Wrote a [paper](pdf/RIPS_Report.pdf) summarizing what we did
* Will give a poster presentation at JMM ([Joint Math Meetings](http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org)) in Denver in
January 2020
