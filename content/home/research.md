## **Mathematics Honors Thesis**

#### [UC Berkeley](https://math.berkeley.edu), August 2019 - May 2020

Continuing my research done at the summer 2019 [RIPS Singapore](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/student-research-programs/research-in-industrial-projects-for-students-rips-2019-singapore/) program, detailed below, in my thesis I will explore Type Theory in greater depth and attempt to implement an extensive type-theoretic theorem prover in Python.

## **[Research in Industrial Projects for Students, Singapore](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/student-research-programs/research-in-industrial-projects-for-students-rips-2019-singapore/)**

#### [National University of Singapore](https://ims.nus.edu.sg), June 2019 - August 2019

Sponsored by [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/), my project was entitled “Exploring a Type-Theoretic Environment for Python”. [Type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory) is an alternative to [Set Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory), and it is easier for a computer to check type-theoretic proofs. Current type-theoretic theorem provers like [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr) are robust, but have a steep learning curve and are difficult to use, so Nvidia wanted us to explore creating a type-theoretic theorem proving environment in Python, with emphasis on ease-of-use and ability to link to Nvidia’s ML and AI algorithms.

My group gave a [presentation](/pdf/CoqBeamerTalk.pdf) to the NUS math community, wrote a [report](pdf/RIPS_Report.pdf) summarizing what we did, and I will give a poster presentation at [Joint Math Meetings](http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org) in Denver in January 2020.
