## **Mathematics Honors Thesis**

#### [UC Berkeley](https://math.berkeley.edu), September 2019 - December 2020

I am intrigued by using [interactive theorem provers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant) to prove important theorems with massive proofs. Thus I will be reading Thomas Hales’ [Dense Sphere Packings: A Blueprint for Formal Proofs](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2431401), which details the proof of the [Kepler Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_conjecture) using the interactive theorem provers [HOL Light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOL_Light) and [Isabelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabelle_(proof_assistant)).

## **[Research in Industrial Projects for Students, Singapore](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/student-research-programs/research-in-industrial-projects-for-students-rips-2019-singapore/)**

#### [National University of Singapore](https://ims.nus.edu.sg), June 2019 - August 2019

Sponsored by [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/), my project was entitled *“Exploring a Type-Theoretic Environment for Python”*. [Type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory) is an alternative to [Set Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory), and it is easier for a computer to check type-theoretic proofs. Current type-theoretic theorem provers like [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr) are robust, but have a steep learning curve and are difficult to use, so Nvidia wanted us to explore creating a type-theoretic theorem proving environment in Python, with emphasis on ease-of-use and ability to link to Nvidia’s ML and AI algorithms.

My group gave a [presentation](/pdf/CoqBeamerTalk.pdf) to the NUS math community, wrote a [report](pdf/RIPS_Report.pdf) summarizing what we did, and I will give a poster presentation at [Joint Math Meetings](http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org) in Denver in January 2020.
