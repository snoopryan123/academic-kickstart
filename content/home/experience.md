* Led a group of undergraduates in RIPS (Research in Industrial Projects for Students) at the IMS (Institute for Mathematical Sciences) at NUS (National University of Singapore)
* Sponsored by Nvidia, my project was entitled “Exploring a Type-Theoretic Environment for Python”
* Type theory is an alternative to Set Theory, and it is easier for a computer to check type-theoretic proofs
* Current type-theoretic theorem provers like Coq are robust, but have a steep learning curve and are difficult to use, so Nvidia wanted us to explore creating a type-theoretic theorem proving environment in Python, with emphasis on ease-of-use and ability to link to Nvidia’s ML and AI algorithms
* Learned about type theory, building a theorem prover, Coq, how to work on math in a team, how to write an extensive math report, and how to give a mathematics talk
* Will give a poster presentation at the Joint Math Meetings (JMM) Conference in Denver in
January 2020
