* Led a group of undergraduates in RIPS ([Research in Industrial Projects for Students](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/student-research-programs/research-in-industrial-projects-for-students-rips-2019-singapore/)) at NUS ([National University of Singapore](https://ims.nus.edu.sg))
* Sponsored by [Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/), my project was entitled “Exploring a Type-Theoretic Environment for Python”
* [Type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory) is an alternative to [Set Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory), and it is easier for a computer to check type-theoretic proofs
* Current type-theoretic theorem provers like [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr) are robust, but have a steep learning curve and are difficult to use, so Nvidia wanted us to explore creating a type-theoretic theorem proving environment in Python, with emphasis on ease-of-use and ability to link to Nvidia’s ML and AI algorithms
* Learned about type theory, building a theorem prover, Coq, how to work on math in a team, how to write an extensive math report, and how to give a mathematics talk
* Will give a poster presentation at JMM ([Joint Math Meetings](http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org)) in Denver in
January 2020

* Learned about Brownian motion (including proofs of its construction, almost-sure continuity, and nowhere differentiability), the Ito Integral, Ito’s product rule, Ito’s Chain rule, Existence and Uniqueness theorems, its connection to finance, and most interestingly, its connection to PDEs (for instance, certain PDEs involving the Laplacian and the Feynman-Kac Formula have stochastic solutions)
