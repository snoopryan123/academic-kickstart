Last summer, I interned in the [Complex Securities Valuation group](https://www.stout.com/en/services/complex-securities-and-financial-instruments/) of [Stout](https://www.stout.com/en/), a global valuation advisory firm. It was my job to find the value of exotic contracts such as [carried interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/carriedinterest.asp) and [earnouts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnout.asp). My boss wanted me to use a [Black-Scholes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackscholes.asp) framework to value these contracts, since they have [option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp)-like features. My coworkers, however, did not have the time or knowledge to teach me about options pricing and the Black-Scholes formula (and none of them were mathematicians). So, I took it upon myself to learn about the fundamentals of options pricing, and wrote about what I learned [here](/pdf/BSPaper.pdf).

I enjoyed learning about the mathematics of options pricing because it drew from many areas of mathematics, such as Brownian motion, Ito calculus, and the heat equation. I left the internship wanting to learn more, so I signed up for the [Berkeley Mathematics Directed Reading Program (DRP)](https://math.berkeley.edu/wp/drp/), in which I read Evans’ [An Introduction to Stochastic Differential Equations](/pdf/EvansSDE.pdf). I learned about Brownian motion (including proofs of its construction, almost-sure continuity, and nowhere differentiability), the Ito Integral, Ito’s product rule, Ito’s Chain rule, Existence and Uniqueness theorems, its connection to finance, and most interestingly, its connection to PDEs (for instance, certain PDEs involving the Laplacian and the Feynman-Kac Formula have stochastic solutions). Then, I wrote a [Beamer presentation](/pdf/SDEbeamer.pdf) on SDEs and presented to the Berkeley math community.
