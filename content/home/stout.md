* Stout
* options pricing
* how I knew I wanted to pursue math full time

Last summer, I interned in the Complex Securities Valuation group of [Stout](https://www.stout.com/en/services/complex-securities-and-financial-instruments/), a global valuation advisory firm. It was my job to find the value of exotic contracts such as the [carried interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/carriedinterest.asp) of a hedge fund and the [earnout](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnout.asp) of an acquisition of one company by another. My boss wanted me to use a [Black-Scholes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackscholes.asp) framework to value these contracts, since they have [option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp) -like features. My coworkers, however, did not have the time or knowledge to teach me about options pricing and the Black-Scholes formula (and none of them were mathematicians). So, I took it upon myself to learn about the fundamentals of options pricing, and summarized what I learned [here](/pdf/BSPaper.pdf)

* Learned about Brownian motion (including proofs of its construction, almost-sure continuity, and nowhere differentiability), the Ito Integral, Ito’s product rule, Ito’s Chain rule, Existence and Uniqueness theorems, its connection to finance, and most interestingly, its connection to PDEs (for instance, certain PDEs involving the Laplacian and the Feynman-Kac Formula have stochastic solutions)
