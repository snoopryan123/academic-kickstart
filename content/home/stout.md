Last summer, I interned in the [Complex Securities Valuation group](https://www.stout.com/en/services/complex-securities-and-financial-instruments/) of [Stout](https://www.stout.com/en/), a global valuation advisory firm. It was my job to find the value of option-like contracts such as [carried interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/carriedinterest.asp) and [earnouts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnout.asp). Thus, I thought it was prudent to learn about the mathematical foundations of options pricing, and wrote about what I learned [here](/pdf/BSPaper.pdf).

I enjoyed learning about the mathematics of options pricing because it drew from many areas of mathematics, such as Brownian motion, Ito calculus, and the heat equation. I left the internship wanting to learn more, so I signed up for the [Berkeley Mathematics Directed Reading Program (DRP)](https://math.berkeley.edu/wp/drp/), in which I read Evansâ€™ [An Introduction to Stochastic Differential Equations](/pdf/EvansSDE.pdf). I wrote a [Beamer presentation](/pdf/SDEbeamer.pdf) on SDEs and presented to the Berkeley math community.
