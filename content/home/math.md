* For my [<u>undergraduate senior thesis</u>](/pdf/Undergrad_Thesis.pdf), I pursued a continuation of [Learning Heuristics for Automated Reasoning through Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08058). I explored using a Graph Neural Network as a branching heuristic in [Conflict Driven Clause Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-driven_clause_learning) for [SAT solving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem).

* As an intern in [securities valuation](https://www.stout.com/en/services/complex-securities-and-financial-instruments), I wrote about the [<u>derivation of the Black-Scholes Formula</u>](/pdf/BSPaper.pdf).

* I love betting on football and basketball games, and I like to see how probability appears in sports betting, so I wrote [Betting and Basic Probability](/pdf/Betting.pdf) and [Moneylines and Implied Win Probability](/pdf/Moneylines.pdf).

* As part of [Research in Industrial Projects for Students, Singapore](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/student-research-programs/research-in-industrial-projects-for-students-rips-2019-singapore/), my group gave a [beamer presentation](/pdf/CoqBeamerTalk.pdf) to the NUS math community, wrote a [report](pdf/RIPS_Report.pdf) summarizing what we did, and presented a [poster](/pdf/JMM2020.pdf) at JMM 2020 in Denver.

* As part of the [Berkeley Mathematics Directed Reading Program](https://math.berkeley.edu/wp/drp/), I read Evansâ€™ [An Introduction to Stochastic Differential Equations](/pdf/EvansSDE.pdf) and gave a [presentation](/pdf/SDEbeamer.pdf) on SDEs to the Berkeley math community.

* The [2 Envelopes Problem](/pdf/2envelopes.pdf) is really cool.
