Last summer, I interned in the [Complex Securities Valuation group](https://www.stout.com/en/services/complex-securities-and-financial-instruments/) of [Stout](https://www.stout.com/en/), a global valuation advisory firm. It was my job to find the value of option-like contracts such as [carried interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/carriedinterest.asp) and [earnouts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/earnout.asp) using the Balck-Scholes framework. The Black-Scholes formula assumes that the underlying asset of the option is a [geometric brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion), and a formula for its value is given by a [Stochastic Differential Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_differential_equation), which was a bit to mathematically complex for me as a sophomore. However, I left the internship wanting to learn more, so I signed up for the [Berkeley Mathematics Directed Reading Program (DRP)](https://math.berkeley.edu/wp/drp/), in which I learned more about Brownian Motion and SDEs by reading Evansâ€™ [An Introduction to Stochastic Differential Equations](/pdf/EvansSDE.pdf). I wrote a [Beamer presentation](/pdf/SDEbeamer.pdf) on SDEs and presented to the Berkeley math community.
