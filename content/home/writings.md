I wrote an exposition on an introduction to options pricing:

* [Deriving the Black-Scholes Formula](/pdf/BSPaper.pdf)

* As part of the [Berkeley Mathematics Directed Reading Program (DRP)](https://math.berkeley.edu/wp/drp/), I read Evansâ€™ [An Introduction to Stochastic Differential Equations](/pdf/EvansSDE.pdf), and wrote a [Beamer presentation](/pdf/SDEbeamer.pdf) on SDEs, which I presented to the Berkeley math community.


I love betting on football and basketball games, and I like to see how probability appears in sports betting. I wrote some articles on the subject:


* [Betting and Basic Probability](/pdf/Betting.pdf) 
* [Moneylines and Implied Win Probability](/pdf/Moneylines.pdf)


* As part of [Research in Industrial Projects for Students, Singapore](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/student-research-programs/research-in-industrial-projects-for-students-rips-2019-singapore/), my group gave a [presentation](/pdf/CoqBeamerTalk.pdf) to the NUS math community, wrote a [report](pdf/RIPS_Report.pdf) summarizing what we did, and I will give a poster presentation at [Joint Math Meetings](http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org) in Denver in January 2020.


* For my Honors Thesis, I will be pursuing a continuation of [Learning Heuristics for Automated Reasoning through Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08058)
