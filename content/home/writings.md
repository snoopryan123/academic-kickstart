I wrote an exposition on an introduction to options pricing:

* [Deriving the Black-Scholes Formula](/pdf/BSPaper.pdf)

[Berkeley Mathematics Directed Reading Program (DRP)](https://math.berkeley.edu/wp/drp/):

* Gave a [Beamer presentation](/pdf/SDEbeamer.pdf) on SDEs to the Berkeley math community
* Read Evansâ€™ [An Introduction to Stochastic Differential Equations](/pdf/EvansSDE.pdf)

I love betting on football and basketball games, and I like to see how probability appears in sports betting:

* [Betting and Basic Probability](/pdf/Betting.pdf) 
* [Moneylines and Implied Win Probability](/pdf/Moneylines.pdf)

[Research in Industrial Projects for Students, Singapore](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/student-research-programs/research-in-industrial-projects-for-students-rips-2019-singapore/):

* Gave a [presentation](/pdf/CoqBeamerTalk.pdf) to the NUS math community
* Wrote a [report](pdf/RIPS_Report.pdf) summarizing what we did

Honors Thesis:

* I am pursuing a continuation of [Learning Heuristics for Automated Reasoning through Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08058)
