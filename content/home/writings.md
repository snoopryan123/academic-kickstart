* I wrote about the [derivation of the Black-Scholes Formula](/pdf/BSPaper.pdf).
[![black-scholes](/img/pdf.gif)](/pdf/BSPaper.pdf)

* I love betting on football and basketball games, and I like to see how probability appears in sports betting, so I wrote [Betting and Basic Probability](/pdf/Betting.pdf) and [Moneylines and Implied Win Probability](/pdf/Moneylines.pdf) .

* As part of [Research in Industrial Projects for Students, Singapore](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/student-research-programs/research-in-industrial-projects-for-students-rips-2019-singapore/), my group gave a [presentation](/pdf/CoqBeamerTalk.pdf) to the NUS math community and wrote a [report](pdf/RIPS_Report.pdf) summarizing what we did.

* As part of the [Berkeley Mathematics Directed Reading Program](https://math.berkeley.edu/wp/drp/), I read Evansâ€™ [An Introduction to Stochastic Differential Equations](/pdf/EvansSDE.pdf) and gave a [presentation](/pdf/SDEbeamer.pdf) on SDEs to the Berkeley math community.

* For my honors thesis, I am pursuing a continuation of [Learning Heuristics for Automated Reasoning through Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08058).
