# I've been to some delicious restaurants around the world. Here are some favorites!

## **Barbeque**

#### [Pappy's Smokehouse, St. Louis](https://www.pappyssmokehouse.com)

1.5 hour line to get in. Tender baby back ribs, savory barbque sauce, unbeatable fries.

## **Italian**

#### [Hostaria Romana, Rome](http://www.hostariaromana.it)

Simply the best Spaghetti alla Carbonara (a sauce featuring eggs and thick juicy bacon).

#### [Rao's, Los Angeles](http://www.raosrestaurants.com/our_story.html)

The biggest bowl of Bolognese I've ever seen at a restaurant. The red sauce here is so tasty that I continually buy it on Amazon to cook with. Even better than the food is the greeter, Johnny Williams, a.k.a. Johnny Roastbeef from the 1990 classic Goodfellas, whose stereotypical Brooklyn-Italian-mobster persona lights up the room.
